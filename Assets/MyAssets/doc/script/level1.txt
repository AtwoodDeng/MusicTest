"So you're all set for money, right?" say the Crow.

I nod my head.

"How much do you totally have?" the Crow ask.

"Not a lot, but it should be enough.
 For the time being" I answer.

"I'll get it from my father. But I need more time." I tell him.

"Do you mean 'steal' ?" said the Crow.)

"picture a terrible sandstorm," he says."Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps chasing you. You change your directions and it adjusts. You can never advoid it because this storm is not something that blew in from far away. This storm is you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, and walk through it, step by step. There's no light there, no friend, no guide, no sense of time."

The boy named Crow softly rests a hand on my shoulder, "From now on you must be the world's strongest fifteen-year-old. To survive, to fight, to win. Remember you can never get rid of the fate."

I didn't answer. And Crow faded away.

["Money will never be enough. I mean, what about the future? You're only fifteen.  No one will hire you, so you can not even support your self." Crow went on, "Besides, the world is totally unknown outside. There are things you never could imagine."
"But I have to get out of here," I said to both him and myself. "No second path to go."

"OK. When you decide to run, then run. But always remember, distance can not solve anything. You have to face what you must face."

I didn't answer. And Crow went away.]

I tell my father a lie, for the money.

He stares at me and blows out a stream of smoke. 

He says, "Get back and watch your damn TV, lier."

Finally, he closes his eyes,
as if nothing has happened.
Then I find his money under the TV.

或许我喜欢小乡镇的简单
Maybe I prefer the simplicity in the small town.
但是我害怕在安逸中的平庸
But I am affraid of the nub?? in the tranquil.

或许我喜欢大城市的热闹
Maybe I prefer the bustle of the big city.
但是我害怕在喧嚣的下疲惫
But I am affraid of the tiredness in the ??.

或许
Maybe...
或许我根本无法做出抉择
Maybe I just cannot make my decision.
摆在我面前有太多的可能
There are too many posibilities in front of me.

我有太多的东西能够失去
There is too much for me to gain
我也有太多的东西能够得到
There is too much for me to lose.
