"One day, you will murder your father, sleep with your mother, and get into your sister's body."
That's my father's word.

"So, you have decided, right?" said the boy named Crow.

"Yes, I'll leave the home as soon as I'm fifteen." I answered.

"What about the money" doubted Crow
"I'll get it from my father. And, of course, he won't know my plan." I told him.

"That money is not enough. I mean, what about the future? You're just fifteen, no one will employ you, so you can not even support your self." Crow went on, "Besides, the world is totally unknown outside. There are things you never could imagine."
"But I have to get out of here," I said to both him and myself. "No second path to go."

"OK. When you decide to run, then run. But always remember, distance can not solve anything. You have to face what you must face."

I didn't answer. And Crow went away.
