========

I'm a fifteen-year-old boy.
And there is a crow in my mind.
The crow can talk with me.
And it live in the world with only black and white.

========

The crow is a strange guy.
He keeps spinning and never gets tired.
He goes here and there.
He goes up and down.

========

Sometimes I hide my thought.
But the crow can always find it out.
He just pull the mask
and release all my thoughts.

========

Nobody likes the world 
he will change its color.
"Hey, it's still black and white"
laughs he, laugh I.
